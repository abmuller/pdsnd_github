# Python Bike-Share Data Supercomputer
*Created: 01/02/2023*

## Project Description & Capabilities
Using Python, this project enables **YOU** to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

This project receives user input from terminal commands, then curates the following bikeshare statistics:

    #1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

    #2 Popular stations and trip (i.e., most common start & end stations)

    #3 Trip duration (Total Travel Time & Average Travel Time)

    #4 User Info (i.e. # of users per user type/gender)

*The User also has the option to view the raw data in 5 row increments.*

## Files Used
1. **bikeshare.py** - the python code file

2. **Three CSV files** each containing individual bike rental data for: New York, Washington, & Chicago.
    * chicago.csv
    * new_york_city.csv
    * washington.csv

## Required Software List
- You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows)


### NumPy & pandas Explained
*NumPy & pandas are open sourced libraries that are the industry standard for working with data in Python. They are both utilized within the bikeshare.py code to enhance the statistical output capabilities of the program. See below to learn more:*
1. **NumPy** - follow [this link](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) for NumPy User Documentation
2. **pandas** - follow [this link](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) for pandas User Documentation
