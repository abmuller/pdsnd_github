# Python Bike-Share Data Supercomputer
*Created: 01/02/2023*

## Description
Using Python, this project enables **YOU** to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

This project receives user input from terminal commands, then curates the following bikeshare statistics:

    #1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

    #2 Popular stations and trip (i.e., most common start & end stations)

    #3 Trip duration (Total Travel Time & Average Travel Time)

    #4 User Info (i.e. # of users per user type/gender)

### Files Used
1. **bikeshare.py** - the python code file

2. *Three CSV files* each containing individual bike rental data for: New York, Washington, & Chicago.


### Credits
*Aside from our wonderful Udacity educators of course...* I must thank [This Wordpress Site](https://wordpress.com/support/markdown-quick-reference/) for teaching me how to do all this cool stuff with Markdown.
